        Advances in Power conversion and Renewable Energy Technologies
    </div>
    <div class="content-desc">
        The growing demand for energy and climatic concerns, have paved the way for energy generation
        from renewable sources. The economic generation and optimised usage of energy demands
        reliable, efficient and effective power conversion mechanisms. The recent advances in power
        electronic interface and smart devices have played a major role for achieving the above mission.
        The objective of the conference is to bring together researchers, academicians, experts and share
        holders to share ideas and perspectives as well as to establish further research cooperation in
        the field of renewable energy technology. This conference aims to provide a platform to discuss
        their work and elaborate on the principles and methods for each technology, an analysis of their
        implementation optimisation, management and economic advantages.
